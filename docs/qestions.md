### Question 1: what is next js?
Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for React applications. It is built on top of React, Node.js, and Webpack, and provides features such as automatic code splitting, hot module replacement, and server-side rendering. Next.js also includes built-in support for routing, data fetching, and API routes, making it a powerful tool for building fast and scalable web applications.

### Question 2: what are the key features of Next.js?
Some key features of Next.js include:
- **Server-side rendering**: Next.js allows you to render React components on the server side, improving performance and SEO.
- **Static site generation** : Next.js can generate static HTML files at build time, enabling fast page loads and improved SEO.
- Automatic code splitting: Next.js automatically splits our code into smaller chunks, reducing the initial load time of our application.
- **Hot module replacement**: Next.js supports hot module replacement, allowing you to update our code without refreshing the page.
- **Built-in routing**: Next.js includes a file-based routing system that makes it easy to create dynamic routes and nested routes.
- **API routes** : Next.js allows you to create API routes that can be used to handle server-side logic and data fetching.

    **what is server side rendering ?**
    Server-side rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering a web page on the server and sending the fully rendered HTML to the client. This can improve performance and SEO by reducing the time it takes to load a page and making it easier for search engines to index the content.

    **what is static site generation ?**
    Static site generation (SSG) is the process of generating static HTML files at build time that can be served to clients without the need for server-side rendering. This can improve performance and SEO by reducing the time it takes to load a page and making it easier for search engines to index the content.

    **what is automatic code splitting ?**
    Automatic code splitting is the process of breaking our code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This can improve performance by reducing the initial load time of our application and only loading the code that is needed for a particular page or feature.

    **what is hot module replacement ?**
    Hot module replacement (HMR) is a feature that allows you to update your code in real time without refreshing the page. This can speed up the development process by allowing you to see changes immediately without losing the state of your application.

    **what is built-in routing ?**
    Built-in routing is a feature that allows you to define routes for your application using a file-based system. This makes it easy to create dynamic routes and nested routes without the need for a separate routing library.

    **what are API routes ?**
    API routes are server-side routes that can be used to handle server-side logic and data fetching. Next.js allows you to create API routes that can be accessed from the client side to fetch data or perform server-side operations.
